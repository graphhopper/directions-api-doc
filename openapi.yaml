  description: |

    With the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api) you can integrate A-to-B route planning, turn-by-turn navigation,
    route optimization, isochrone calculations and other tools in your application.

    The GraphHopper Directions API consists of the following RESTful web services:

     * [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API),
     * [Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API),
     * [Isochrone API](#tag/Isochrone-API),
     * [Map Matching API](#tag/Map-Matching-API),
     * [Matrix API](#tag/Matrix-API) and
     * [Geocoding API](#tag/Geocoding-API).

    ### Getting started

     1. To use one of these APIs, you require an API key. Sign up [here](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) to get one.
     2. Read the documentation of the desired API below.
     3. Start using the API.

    You can see the Routing and Geocoding API in action at [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps). You can see the Route Optimization API in action in the [route editor](https://graphhopper.com/blog/2015/07/21/graphhoppers-new-route-optimization-editor/) available in the [dashboard](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api), the route optimization uses the Matrix API under the hood.

    To use our Directions API commercially, you can subscribe to a paid plan [here](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/pricing).

    ### Problems or Questions?

    If you have problems or questions, we offer you the following options:

     * [FAQ](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/)

     * [Open ticket](https://graphhopper.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new)
     * [Contact us](https://graphhopper.com/#contact)


    ## API Clients

    To speed up development and make coding easier, we offer the following clients:

     * [JavaScript client](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client) - try the [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/)
     * [Others](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-clients) like C#, Ruby, PHP, Python, ... automatically created for the Route Optimization API

    ### Bandwidth reduction

    If you create your own client, make sure it supports http/2 and gzipped responses.

    If you use the Matrix or Route Optimization API and want to solve large problems, we recommend you to reduce bandwidth
    by [compressing your POST request](https://gist.github.com/karussell/82851e303ea7b3459b2dea01f18949f4)
    and specifying the header as follows: `Content-Encoding: gzip`.

    ### Keep up-to-date

    -->

    **Please note, that turn restrictions are considered only with `ch.disable=true`
    and for the free package you can only choose from `car`, `bike` or `foot`.**

    If you need car routing that uses speed estimated from traffic data, then we also provide
    this via TomTom data. [Please contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/) for more
    details.

    We also offer a sophisticated `motorcycle` profile powered by the [Kurviger](https://kurviger.de/en) Routing API.
    Kurviger favors curves and slopes while avoiding cities and highways.

    Also we offer vehicle profiles with different properties, different speed profiles
    or different access options.

    You can try the route results for every profile with [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/)

        ### Introduction

        ![Routing screenshot](./img/routing-example.png)

        The Routing API is part of the GraphHopper Directions API. Routing is the process of finding the best path connecting
        two or more points, where the meaning of ''best'' depends on the vehicle and use case.

        ### Navigation
        If you plan to use the Routing API for navigation, have a look at our [open source demo navigation application](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example) and adapt it to your needs.

        ### Fast
        To get started using this API, just provide two or more points and retrieve the fastest route through the road
        network that connects them. This type of request is heavily optimized for query performance, so it does not
        take turn restrictions into account, and it does not allow for some advanced features.
        ### Flexible
        Enable turn restrictions and unlock further flexible features via `ch.disable=true`.
        Please note that some options make the request more expensive, see the [FAQ](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/) for more details.
      parameters:
        - name: point
          in: query
          description: |
            The points for which the route should be calculated. Format: `[latitude,longitude]`. Specify at least an origin and a destination. Via points are possible.
            The maximum number depends on your plan.

            $ref: '#/components/schemas/VehicleProfileId'
        - name: locale
          in: query
          description: |
            The locale of the resulting turn instructions. E.g. `pt_PT` for Portuguese or `de` for German.
          schema:
            type: string
            default: en
        - name: elevation
          in: query
          description: |
            If `true`, a third coordinate, the altitude, is included to all positions in the response.
            This changes the format of the `points` and `snapped_waypoints` fields of the response, in both their
            encodings. Unless you switch off the `points_encoded` parameter, you need special code on the
            client side that can handle triple coordinates.
            A request can fail if the vehicle profile does not support elevation. See the features object for every vehicle profile.
          schema:
            type: boolean
            default: false
        - name: details
          in: query
          description: |
            Optional parameter to retrieve path details. You can request additional details for the route: `street_name` and `time`.
            For all motor vehicle profiles, we additionally support `max_speed`, `toll`, `road_class`, `road_environment`, and `surface`.
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
          explode: true
        - in: query
          name: optimize
          description: |
            Normally, the calculated route will visit the points in the order you specified them.
            If you have more than two points, you can set this parameter to `true` and the points may be re-ordered to minimize the total travel time.
            Keep in mind that the limits on the number of locations of the Route Optimization API applies, and the request is more expensive.
          schema:
            type: boolean
            default: false
        - in: query
          name: instructions
          description: |
            If instructions should be calculated and returned
          schema:

            default: true
        - name: calc_points
          in: query
          description: |
            If the points for the route should be calculated at all.

            type: boolean
            default: false
          description: |
            If `true`, the output will be formatted.
        - name: points_encoded
          in: query
          description: |
            If `false`, the coordinates in `point` and `snapped_waypoints` are returned as lists of positions using the order `[lon,lat,elevation]`.
            This format may be easier to handle, but can consume a lot of bandwidth for long routes.
            If `true`, the coordinates will be encoded as a string. You'll need to decode this string in client code.
            We provide open source code in Java and JavaScript, see the clients section.
          schema:
            type: boolean

          in: query
          description: |
            Which kind of ''best'' route calculation you need. Other option is `shortest` (e.g. for `vehicle=foot` or `bike`), `short_fastest` if time and distance is expensive e.g. for `vehicle=truck`
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: heading
          in: query
          description: |
            Favour a heading direction for a certain point. Specify either one heading for the start point or as many as there are points.
            In this case headings are associated by their order to the specific points. Headings are given as north based clockwise angle between 0 and 360 degree.
            This parameter also influences the tour generated with `algorithm=round_trip` and forces the initial direction.

            Block road access via a point with the format `latitude,longitude`
            or an area defined by a circle `lat,lon,radius` or a rectangle `lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2`.

        - name: avoid
          in: query
          description: |
            Specify which road classes you would like to avoid (currently only
            supported for motor vehicles like `car`). Possible values are `ferry`, `motorway`, `toll`, `tunnel` and `ford`.

          description: |
            Rather than looking for the shortest or fastest path, this lets you solve two different problems related to routing:
            With `round_trip`, the route will get you back to where you started. This is meant for fun (think of
            a bike trip), so we will add some randomness.
            With `alternative_route`, we give you not one but several routes that are close to optimal, but
            not too similar to each other. You can control both of these features with additional parameters, see below.
        - name: round_trip.distance
          in: query
          description: |
            If `algorithm=round_trip`, this parameter configures approximative length of the resulting round trip.

            format: int64
        - name: alternative_route.max_paths
          in: query
          description: |
            If `algorithm=alternative_route`, this parameter sets the number of maximum paths which should be calculated. Increasing can lead to worse alternatives.

          in: query
          description: |
            If `algorithm=alternative_route`, this parameter sets the factor by which the alternatives routes can be longer than the optimal route. Increasing can lead to worse alternatives.

        You can get an example response via:

        ```
        curl "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/isochrone?point=51.131108,12.414551&key=[YOUR_KEY]"
        ```

        Don't forget to replace the placeholder with your own key.

        ### Introduction
        ![Isochrone screenshot](./img/isochrone-example.png)

        An isochrone of a location is ''a line connecting points at which a vehicle arrives at the same time'', see Wikipedia.
        With the same API you can also calculate isodistances, just use the parameter distance_limit instead of time_limit`.

        ### Use Cases
        Some possible areas in which this API may be useful to you:

        - real estate analysis
        - realtors
        - vehicle scheduling
        - geomarketing
        - reach of electric vehicles
        - transport planning
        - logistics (distribution and retail network planning)

        ```

        ### Introduction

        ![Matrix Example](./img/matrix-example.png)

        The Matrix API is part of the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api) and with
        this API you can calculate many-to-many distances, times or routes a lot more efficient than calling the
        Routing API multiple times.

        In the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API) we support multiple points, so called 'via points', which results in one
        route being calculated. The Matrix API results in NxM routes or more precise NxM weights, distances or times being calculated
        but is a lot faster compared to NxM single requests. The most simple example is a tourist trying to decide
        which pizza is close to him instead of using beeline distance she can calculate a 1x4 matrix. Or a delivery service in the
        need of often big NxN matrices to solve vehicle routing problems. E.g. the [GraphHopper Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API)
        uses the Matrix API under the hood to achieve this.

        Some other use case scenarios for the Matrix API:

         * Logistic problems often pick up many items from and deliver them to many locations.
         * Calculating detours with many possible points in-between and selecting the best e.g. interesting for ridesharing or taxi applications. For this 1-to-many requests are necessary.
         * Finding the best tour for a tourist in the need to visit as many points of interests as possible.
         * ...

        ### API Clients and Examples

        See the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main document and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#matrix).

        ### Description

        The Matrix API calculates the well known distance-matrix for a set of points, i.e. it calculates all the distances between every point combination. But we do not stop there, we also offer a time-, weight- and route-matrix. The weight-matrix can be used as raw input for e.g. a vehicle routing problem ([VRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem)) and is more precise than a time- or distance-matrix. E.g. for bike routes the actual weight of a route (e.g. the "beauty") is what you want to decide if a route is 'better' and not always the taken time or distance.

        A simple illustration for a 3x3 matrix with identical from and to points:

         -          |to_point1|to_point2|to_point3
        :-----------|:--------|:--------|:--------
        from_point1 |0        |1->2     | 1->3
        from_point2 |2->1     |0        | 2->3
        from_point3 |3->1     |3->2     | 0

        A simple illustration for a 1x3 matrix with different start- and end-points:

         -          | to_point1  | to_point2 | t_point3
        :-----------|:-----------|:----------|:--------
        from_pointA |A->1        |A->2       |A->3


        For every route 1->2, 1-3, ... or A->1,A->2,A->3 you can return only the weight, the time and the distance. To calculate full routes you can use the [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API) which also has a lot of different parameters.

        ### Limits and Counts

        The cost for one request depends on the number of locations and is documented [here](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/#what-is-one-credit).

        One request should not exceed the Matrix API location limit depending on the package, see the pricing in our dashboard.

      summary: Execute a matrix request
      description: |
        The GET request has an URL length limitation, which hurts for many locations per request. In those cases use a HTTP POST request with JSON data as input. The only parameter
        in the URL will be the key. Both request scenarios are identical except that all singular parameter names are named as their plural for a POST request.
        All effected parameters are: `points`, `from_points`, `to_points`, and `out_array`.

        For example `point=10,11&point=20,22` will be converted to the following JSON `points` array:
        ```json
        { "points": [[11,10], [22,20]] }
        ```
        Note that also the order changes to `[longitude,latitude]` similar to [GeoJson](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#examples).

        Example:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix?key=[YOUR_KEY]" -d '{"elevation":false,"out_arrays":["weights"],"from_points":[[-0.087891,51.534377],[-0.090637,51.467697],[-0.171833,51.521241],[-0.211487,51.473685]],"to_points":[[-0.087891,51.534377],[-0.090637,51.467697],[-0.171833,51.521241],[-0.211487,51.473685]],"vehicle":"car"}'

      summary: Post a matrix request in batch mode
      description: |
        The Batch Matrix API allows using matrices with more locations and works asynchronously - similar to our Route Optimization API:
         * Create a HTTP POST request against `/matrix/calculate` and add the key in the URL: `/matrix/calculate?key=[YOUR_KEY]`. This will give you the `job_id` from the response json like `{ "job_id": "7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097" }`
         * Poll via HTTP GET requests every second against `/matrix/solution/[job_id]`

        Here are some full examples via curl:
        ```bash
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/calculate?key=[YOUR_KEY]" -d '{"points":[[13.29895,52.48696],[13.370876,52.489575],[13.439026,52.511206]]}'
        {"job_id":"7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097"}
        ```

        Pick the returned `job_id` and use it in the next GET requests:
        ```bash
        $ curl -X GET "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/solution/7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097?key=[YOUR_KEY]"
        {"status":"waiting"}
        ```

        When the calculation is finished (`status:finished`) the JSON response will contain the full matrix JSON under `solution`:
        ```bash
        $ curl -X GET "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/solution/7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097?key=[YOUR_KEY]"
        {"solution":{"weights":[[0.0,470.453,945.414],[503.793,0.0,580.871],[970.49,569.511,0.0]],"info":{"copyrights":["GraphHopper","OpenStreetMap contributors"]}},"status":"finished"}
        ```

        Please note that if an error occured while calculation the JSON will not have a status but contain directly the error message e.g.:
        ```json
        {"message":"Cannot find from_points: 1","hints":[{...}]}
        ```

        You get an example response for a GPX via:

        ```
        curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/gpx+xml" "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/match?vehicle=car&key=[YOUR_KEY]" --data @/path/to/some.gpx
        ```

        ### Introduction
        ![Map Matching screenshot](./img/map-matching-example.gif)

        The Map Matching API is part of the GraphHopper Directions API and with this API you can snap measured GPS points typically as GPX files to a digital
        road network to e.g. clean data or attach certain data like elevation or turn instructions to it. Read more at Wikipedia.

        In the example screenshot above and demo you see the Map Matching API in action where the black line is the GPS track and the green one is matched result.

        ### API Clients and Examples
        See the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main documentation, and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#map-matching).

        ### Limits and Counts
        The cost for one request depends on the number of GPS location and is documented [here](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/).

        One request should not exceed the Map Matching API location limit depending on the package, see the pricing in our dashboard.

        ### Introduction

        ![Geocoding Example](./img/geocoding-example.png)

        _Geocoding_ describes the process of transforming an textual address representation to a coordinate (`latitude,longitude`).
        For example the conversion from `Berlin` to `52.5170365,13.3888599`.

        _Reverse geocoding_ converts a coordinate to a textual address representation or place name. Find out more about Geocoding itself on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding).

      summary: Solve vehicle routing problem
      description: |2
         ### Introduction

         ![VRP Example Screenshot](./img/vrp.png)

        The Route Optimization API can be used to solve traveling salesman or vehicle routing problems. These problems occur almost everywhere in the world
        of moving things and people. For example, every company dealing with last-mile deliveries faces a vehicle routing problem, i.e. it must find ways to
        efficiently service its customers given a variety of requirements: customer requirements like time windows,
        the product's transport requirements e.g. that items need to be refrigerated, must be picked up first, driver skills, vehicles/capacities available
        and more.

        Even though these problems are relatively easy to understand, finding reasonable solutions is way more difficult.
        You need to calculate travel times and distances on large road networks, you need to formalize your vehicle routing problem and to specify
         your manifold business constraints, you need fast and efficient algorithms and quite a significant amount of computational power.

        This is where <b>GraphHopper Route Optimization API</b> comes into play. Just learn how to put your problem into our easy-to-understand json format, post it and
        our services will do the heavy work. To make it even easier for you, we provide you with API clients for the different programming languages.

        ### Endpoint

        The endpoint is `https://graphhopper.com/api/[version]/vrp`

        The Route Optimization API works in two steps
        1. Post your problem json:

        ```
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/vrp/optimize?key=[YOUR_KEY]" --data @your-vrp-problem.json
        ```

        2. Poll every 500ms until a solution is available: `

        ```
        curl -X GET "https://graphhopper.com/api/1/vrp/solution/[RETURNED_JOB_ID]?key=[YOUR_KEY]"
        ```

        For more details also about the format of the `your-vrp-problem.json` file you can use one of [the examples](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client/tree/master/route-optimization-examples).

        ### API Clients and Examples

        We offer a number of clients to make coding against the Route Optimization API easier (see the [clients](#section/API-Clients) section in the main document and [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/#optimization)).

        ### Tutorials

        To make modelling your vehicle routing problem easier, we provide you with an increasing number of [tutorials](https://www.graphhopper.com/tutorial/).

        ### Route Editor

        The [route editor](https://graphhopper.com/blog/2015/07/21/graphhoppers-new-route-optimization-editor/) in the Directions API dashboard is a helpful tool to understand the JSON input and output format.
        This way, you can learn the Optimization API just by using it. It allows you to specify simple vehicle routing problems, solve them and analyse
                the API response visually, i.e. on a map, or as raw data.

            Type of objective function, i.e. `min` or `min-max`.

             * `min`: Minimizes the objective value.
             * `min-max`: Minimizes the maximum objective value.

            For instance, `min` -> `vehicles` minimizes the number of employed vehicles.
            `min` -> `completion_time` minimizes the sum of your vehicle routes' completion time.

            If you use, for example, `min-max` -> `completion_time`, it minimizes the maximum of your vehicle routes' completion time, i.e. it minimizes the overall makespan.
            This only makes sense if you have more than one vehicle. In case of one vehicle, switching from `min` to `min-max` should not have any impact.
            If you have more than one vehicle, then the algorithm tries to constantly move stops from one vehicle to another such that
            the completion time of longest vehicle route can be further reduced. For example, if you have one vehicle that takes 8 hours
            to serve all customers, adding another vehicle (and using `min-max`) might halve the time to serve all customers to 4 hours. However,
            this usually comes with higher transport costs.

            If you want to minimize `vehicles` first and, second, `completion_time`, you can also combine different objectives like this:

            ```json
            "objectives" : [
               {
                  "type": "min",
                  "value": "vehicles"
               },
               {
                  "type": "min",
                  "value": "completion_time"
               }
            ]
            ```

            If you want to balance activities or the number of stops among all employed drivers, you need to specify it as follows:

            ```json
            "objectives" : [
               {
                  "type": "min-max",
                  "value": "completion_time"
               },
               {
                  "type": "min-max",
                  "value": "activities"
               }
            ]
            ```
          default: min
          enum:
            - min
            - min-max
        value:
          type: string
          default: transport_time
          description: |
            The value of the objective function.
            The objective value `transport_time` solely considers the time
            your drivers spend on the road, i.e. transport time. In contrary to `transport_time`, `completion_time` also takes waiting times at customer sites into account.
            The `completion_time` of a route is defined as the time from starting to ending the route,
            i.e. the route's transport time, the sum of waiting times plus the sum of activity durations.
            Note that choosing `transport_time` or `completion_time` only makes a difference if you specified time windows for your services/shipments since only in
            scenarios with time windows waiting times can occur.
            The objective value `vehicles` can only be used along with `min` and minimizes vehicles.

            Specifies the type of relation. It must be either of type `in_same_route`, `in_sequence` or `in_direct_sequence`.

            `in_same_route`: As the name suggest, it enforces the specified services or shipments to be in the same route. It can be specified as follows:

            ` { "type": "in_same_route", "ids": ["service_i_id","service_j_id"] } `

            This enforces service i to be in the same route as service j no matter which vehicle will be employed. If a specific vehicle (driver) is required to conduct this, just add a `vehicle_id` like this:

            ` { "type": "in_same_route", "ids": ["service_i_id","service_j_id"], "vehicle_id": "vehicle1" } `

            This not only enforce service i and j to be in the same route, but also makes sure that both services are in the route of `vehicle1`.

            *Tip*: This way initial loads and vehicle routes can be modelled. For example, if your vehicles are already on the road and new orders come in, then vehicles can still be rescheduled subject to the orders that have already been assigned to these vehicles.



            `in_sequence`: This relation type enforces n jobs to be in sequence. It can be specified as

            ` { "type": "in_sequence", "ids": ["service_i_id","service_j_id"] } `

            which means that service j need to be in the same route as service i AND it needs to occur somewhere after service i. As described above if a specific vehicle needs to conduct this, just add `vehicle_id`.


            `in_direct_sequence`: This enforces n services or shipments to be in direct sequence. It can be specified as

            ` { "type": "in_direct_sequence", "ids": ["service_i_id","service_j_id","service_k_id"] } `

            yielding service j to occur directly after service i, and service k to occur directly after service j i.e. in strong order. Again, a vehicle can be assigned a priority by adding a `vehicle_id` to the relation.


            *Special IDs*:
            If you look at the previous example and you want service i to be the first in the route, use the special ID `start` as follows:

            ` { "type": "in_direct_sequence", "ids": ["start","service_i_id","service_j_id","service_k_id"] } `

            Latter enforces the direct sequence of i, j and k at the beginning of the route. If this sequence should be bound to the end of the route, use the special ID `end` like this:

            ` { "type": "in_direct_sequence", "ids": ["service_i_id","service_j_id","service_k_id","end"] } `

            If you deal with services then you need to use the 'id' of your services in the field 'ids'. To also consider sequences of the pickups and deliveries of your shipments, you need to use a special ID, i.e. use the shipment id plus the keyword `_pickup` or `_delivery`. For example, to ensure that the pickup and delivery of the shipment with the id 'my_shipment' are direct neighbors, you need the following specification:

            ` { "type": "in_direct_sequence", "ids": ["my_shipment_pickup","my_shipment_delivery"] } `

          example: in_direct_sequence
        ids:

If you want to place a service or shipment activity at the beginning of your route, use the special ID `start`. In turn, use `end` to place it at the end of the route.'
